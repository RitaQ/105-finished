                    <p class="bg-warning">&nbsp&nbsp Minister Hermione Jean Granger (b. 19 September, 1979) was a Muggle-born witch born to Mr
                        and Mrs Granger, both dentists. Hermione was raised as a Muggle girl until, at age eleven, when she
                        learned that she was a witch and had been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                        She began attending the school on 1 September, 1991, where she was subsequently sorted into Gryffindor
                        House, despite being considered for Ravenclaw. She possessed a brilliant academic mind, and proved
                        to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied. She was very studious and bookish.

                                enables her to go back in time and handle her heavy class schedule, though this is not revealed
                                until the penultimate chapter.</li>
